Hello guys, I have just thought about a theory that some of my friends approve. Like we already presume and assume the Mad Kind became mad because of Bran. But I think I could have something interesting (likely not true but still) about it. First of all, we know that Bran vision in the past can have consequences onto people in the past (cf. Hodor) when he links the present + the past. But he can also create consequences without that link. Indeed, we have seen Bran interacted with his father. So planning for this weekend, friends group will play 1000 point lists either 2v2 or 1v1 round robin mini tournament depending on the time we have. Were semi competitive so not beer and pretzels but were not try hards. Also we house rule no named characters, we play a thousand nameless battlefields with a million nameless soldiers that no hero or villain would ever even hear of. So no ahriman :/ Other lists will be ork lootas with gretchen and boyz in trukks, an IG parking lot, and eldar. Selling off my collection. All have boxes, although some may have been displayed without (not many). Some boxes have small tears or damage. Will notify of this before sale. Willing to negotiate on sales of multiple items. All prices US. Shipping (not included in price) will depend on location but I am flexible and open to negotiation. amp#x200B; Proof: https://imgur.com/a/Pn8aeZb (https://imgur.com/a/Pn8aeZb) amp#x200B; Thanks for looking!

So, a couple of weeks before I posted my initial impressions, after I went to 500 points tourney. That time was our first "fluff" tournament in FLGS. Rules were simple: we use narrative play and narrative missions, tournament lists are banned, you have to have some sort of a narrative or some kind of a story for your army, 1000 points and drinking is allowed. So I sent my initial narrative.

Whilst I was doing some casual reading on da filfy hoomans that are the guard (or Astra Militarum now I suppose) I noticed a few references to female soldiers, but I didn’t know if GW ever actually made models of any. I’ve played for years but having never collected Guard I’ve never paid much attention to the models, other than looting the occasional vehicle and weapon for da Boyz. Are their any official GW minis of female guards 
What I love about DnD is that sometimes it just totally goes off rails. A couple of bad dice rolls and you are in trouble. You can not predict the outcome. The streets of the city of Soldier are crowded. Everybody is excited because the arrival of the carnival. Our adventuring party is visiting the Raven Queen temple. Val (Tiefling RQ Cleric) and Leeroy (Half orc Barbarian) are inside the temple, Dr. Yeti (Bugbear Warlock) is waiting outside. Times passes and the Dr. starts to get bored. This is what is sent to the last Black Library contest, it didn't win but I wanted to share it anyway. Summary: The lush forestal agri-world of Oleandria under Imperial control is suddenly attacked by Nurgle’s forces. The Elysian drop troops are sent to aid but the rot is quickly spread across the endless forests of mushroom trees and their spores start to turn people into wheezing zombies. On top of that a passing WAAAGH of Snakebites notices the war below and makes landfall </p>
