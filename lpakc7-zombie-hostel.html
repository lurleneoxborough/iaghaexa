The are used to staying at hostels when they travel, Ms Jade’s came highly recommended. Last night, my bedtime movie was House of 1000 Corpses (it's on Hulu now!) and while I was watching, I was actually debating who has the creep factor down better, Roth or Zombie? In my mind, I think Rob Zombie gets in your head more and Eli Roth just likes to collect vomit experiences. I have to admit, though, some of Roth's idea can make me shudder (still, can't shave my legs without thinking about Cabin Fever) I just wanted to get other's opinions.

Hey guys! I'm looking for something to do with friends this Halloween. Does anyone of you know of a place (hopefully near downtown) that has a truly scary haunted house? I'm not looking for the typical thing that a 12 year old can go in and they have creepy statues. I want something where me and my friends (all early 20s) can go and experience a night we won't forget. I don't want to get tied up and spit on but I want to be really creeped out. I tried a couple of google searches A new hostel may be built across the street from the 30th and Downing transit station in Denver’s Five Points neighborhood. Denver-based Mainspring Development is planning to develop a five-story hostel (potentially named Cabarita House) at 3030 Welton, currently an empty lot. The site is located.

I'm not a fan of the slasher genre so I can't comment on any of those. Still a few that spring to mind are Midnight Meat Train (directed by a great japanese director), Red Victoria (really original and well written), The Orphanage (at least this got some coverage), Infestation (funny and yet still managed to hit some strong horror notes), Feast (I only really liked the first.

Recruiting Joe was initially a mistake. He was standing next to a craftsman I actually wanted to recruit. Joe was a utilities specialist, and my community already had one. By the time I realized my mistake the enclave had dispersed. I was pretty vexed, and I’m not proud to admit this, but I would often send Joe on suicide missions. Sending him out with little to no ammo at night, sometimes without enough fuel to get back, sometimes with no vehicle at all. But that son of a bitch came back every. Yesyesyesyesyes.

I work at a used record/movie/book store, and I've been able to "rent" movies for free. This has lately made my interest in horror more of an obsession, and I'm looking for some titles that I haven't seen that might be worth watching. I even enjoy shitty horror movies at times, so I'm really open to anything that you think is worth watching. I want stuff I haven't seen, so obscure stuff is obvio.

The general consensus seems to be we're currently experiencing a great time for horror, the best decade since the 80s many would say. But is it really better than the 2000s, a decade which many consider a low point ? amp#x200B; One thing I think is that foreign horror, especially from Europe experienced a real strong spell.

I don't know how to start but I think I have come to an end. I have had an OK life, much better than most of people had luck to have. I mean,I grew up in a 3rd world country, I saw a civil war as a kid, and then my father got sick like very sick and I am lucky he survived, only 1 out of 10000 people that have his condition survive it. He lost so much fucking weight I still remember looking at him and not going Libertarian Leader Friedmanite19 spent Thursday morning in the South East, and attended a town hall style coffee morning in Woking. The event was attended by Surrey candidate cthulhuiscool2, local people and members of the local press. ampnbsp; --- ampnbsp; gt cthulhuiscool2: “I must first thank the Defence Secretary for taking the time from his exceedingly busy schedule to spend time in Surrey. No other party leader has visited this part of the country - which only proves OK so that happened a few years ago but I'm still mad whenever I think about it so here's the story so you can laugh/cry with me. Context: friend asked me to be a bridesmaid. I was very happy and excited to be asked at first. However, my job at the time was horrible. Me and my coworkers really went through some awful stuff. I'm not going to detail it here because this is another story but just know that we actually had to go to the tribunal with our employer. For two years, I became a zombie:. I've been watching the Hellraiser films, and they're infamous for low-budget, shit sequels that were re purposed from rejected scripts never intended to be Hellraiser movies, including releasing two films in the same year (2005). It also generally seems to be accepted that this was all an attempt by New Line Cinema to keep the rights for an EVENTUAL reboot. Seeing all the modern remakes and sequels to classic horror franchises, I'm curious why this stuff didn't take over earlier. Curse of Chuck. 
So, my hostel wifi bans using torrents so I've to use sites to watch and downoad anime. Usually I have to download them epiosde by episode. So, I want to make a script to download batch animes. I'm planning first coding CLI and then moving this to GUI so my friends can also use it. All is fine, but when I reach the download site( say this ( the 'Download' button's href is 'dynamically loaded' ( I have to run javascript in the webpage? I have recently been seeing this chick who is fucking amazing, and one of the things she and I share is a love for absolutely insane horror movies. The first time we hung out I showed her Don't Breathe, and we ended with A Serbian Film. Last night we watched I Spit On Your Grave and The Last House On The Left (new version). I told her to check out Hard Candy today while I am at work, I feel like that is a must-see.
